Installation
============
There are two ways of installing - from packaged binary or source.

From package
------------
1. Download the latest binary package (.crx)
2. Allow installation
   ** note: from now on the extension should auto update whenever a new version is released **   

From source
-----------
1. Clone into this repo or download and extract a zip/tarball version
2. Switch to "extension manager" & enable "developer mode"
3. Choose "load unpacked extension" and select the directory where you put the files

Setup
=====
1. Right-click on the toolbar icon and choose "options"
2. Enter connection details
3. Click save to persist changes and activate the extension

Tracking
========
I'm currently using Google Analytics for basic usage tracking. It's all anonymous and the purpose
is to be able to see browser/extension version and rough geographical dispersion.
If you fork this repo, please switch to your own tracking id. It's in the tcstatus/views/analytics.js file.
